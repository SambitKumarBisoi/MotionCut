# MotionCut
This repository showcases the work completed during my one-month internship at Motion Cut, where I focused on web development and Python programming. Throughout the internship, I gained hands-on experience in developing dynamic web applications and leveraging Python for backend processes.

Key Highlights:
Front-End Development: Built responsive web pages using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, ensuring a user-friendly and mobile-responsive design.
Back-End Development: Developed server-side logic with Python, integrating it with web frameworks like Flask/Django to create seamless web applications.
Database Integration: Worked with relational databases, designing and implementing data models and performing CRUD operations.
APIs: Developed and consumed RESTful APIs to ensure smooth communication between the client and server.
Version Control: Used Git and GitHub for collaborative development, managing code, and tracking changes.
This internship provided valuable experience in full-stack development, enhancing both my programming skills and understanding of real-world software development workflows.

Feel free to explore the code, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out with any questions!
